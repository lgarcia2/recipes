# Chokecherry Wine

Recipe made on 2022-07-27
Somewhat based on https://hildaskitchenblog.com/recipe/how-to-make-a-gallon-of-chokecherry-wine/

## Ingredients

8.5 lbs - Chokecherries (Seed in, stem on, unprocessed)
4 cups - Sugar

12 cups - water


## Steps
1. Boil & Mash Chokecherries
    I'm doing this in multiple passes since I don't have a large stockpot. I do have a regular sized stockpot that most normal kitchens would have and I'm filling it halfway
    - Fill half a stock pot with chokecherries
    - Add 2 cup water
    - Add 1 cup sugar

    TODO: How many 'half filled' pots did this take?

    2*3 = 6 cups
    1*3 =
