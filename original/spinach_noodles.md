Recipe made on
- 2023-06-07

## Ingredients

### Required
- Angel Hair Pasta (Spaghetti will work, but its just not the same)
- Frozen Spinach 
    - One block
- Butter 
    - 2 Tbsp
- Bullion (preferably chicken)
    - 1/2 Tbsp "Better Than Bullion" (or half a cube, enough that would normally make 1/2 cup stock)
- Garlic
    - Powdered 1/2 Tbsp
- Lemon Juice
    - 1 Tbsp
- Artichokes Canned/Jarred and 1/4 cup of the juice they come in 
    - To Taste


### Optional
- White Onion
    - Half
- If you dont have artichokes, put in 1/2 Tbsp Italian Seasoning
- Mozzerella Cheese (I used little mozzerella balls)
- Parmesean Cheese

## Steps

# Noodles
- Start cooking the pasta in salt water. The noodles, they must taste like the sea.

# Sauce
- Put the spinach in a saucepan and start cooking on medium
- Once the spinach has cooked a bit, maybe half frozen, add all ingredients except the Lemon Juice and cheeses. Don't forget the artichoke juice!
- Cook until there's no loose water in the saucepan. You don't want the sauce to start browning, but it shouldn't be very watery
- As you finish cooking the sauce, add the lemon juice right at the end.
- Salt and Pepper to taste.

Put the noodles on the plate and then put the sauce on top, just like spaghetti. Cheese goes on top last.
