# Pumpkin Seeds

## Ingredients

### Required
- Table Salt
    - 1 tbsp per pumpkin
- Oil (oil, vegtable, canola, your choice)
    - 1 tbsp per pumpkin

### Optional
- Kosher Salt
    - to taste
- Garlic Powder
    - to taste


## Steps

- Seperate Pumpkin guts from the seeds as much as possible
- Rinse and put seeds through colander to get even more pumpkin guts off
- Add the seeds and salt (1 Tbsp per pumpkin) to a pot of water and boil for 10 min
- Seperate seeds from water and let dry for a while (minimum 30 min, I've done overnight before too though)
- Add Oil to dry-ish seeds and mix to coat seeds in oil. Also, this is a good time to add Kosher Salt and Garlic Powder (or any other spices) to taste so that the seeds are coated.
- Spread thinly on baking sheets (preferably with edges)
- Bake at 350 F for 30 min
